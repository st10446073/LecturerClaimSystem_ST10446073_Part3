Step 2: Database Migration and SetupThe application uses Entity Framework Core with SQLite. You must ensure the database file (app.db) contains the correct Identity tables (AspNetUsers, etc.). This process requires clearing old files and creating a fresh database.Aggressive Cleanup: Manually delete the following items from the project folder:The app.db file.The entire Migrations folder.Create Final Migration: Generate the migration file containing both Claims and Identity tables.Bashdotnet ef migrations add FinalDatabaseSetup
Update Database: Build the database file (app.db) from the migration.Bashdotnet ef database update --connection "DataSource=app.db"
Step 3: Run the ApplicationExecute the application from the main project folder.Bashdotnet run
The application will start, typically listening on http://localhost:5033.🔑 Test AccountsYou can log in and test the multi-tiered workflow using the following credentials (password is 123 for all):RoleUsernamePasswordProgramme Coordinatorcoordinator123Academic Managermanager123Lecturerlecturer123
